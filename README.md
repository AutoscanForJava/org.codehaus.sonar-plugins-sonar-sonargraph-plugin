## Description / Features
This plugin can be used to check the conformance of your code base to a 
formal architecture definition created with Sonargraph 7. A free license 
is available to allow you to check and measure the overall coupling and 
the level of cyclic dependencies at the package level. Usually a high 
level of coupling and cyclic dependencies points to a high level of 
structural erosion. If structural erosion grows over a certain level 
this will have a negative impact on testability, maintainability and 
comprehensibility of your code.
